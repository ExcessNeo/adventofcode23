# Advent of Code 2023

Solutions separated by day, most will have both solutions printed as output but not always. All written in "C" (compiled as C++ for function overriding) with limited use of the standard library.

Tokenizer and most of the common code based on work by Casey Muratori (https://mollyrocket.com/) in Handmade Hero (https://hero.handmade.network/)
